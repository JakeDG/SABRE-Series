# SABRE_Series
The collection of a SABRE missions available on the Arma 3 Steam workshop here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=219937751

The Sabre Series follows a story that takes place in an alternate universe to Arma 3's. The series starts off in 2035, twelve years after the botched invasion of the Republic of Altis by CSAT in the year 2023 known as the November Offensive. This event sparked global tensions that have only been growing increasingly more hostile in the years following. With CSAT attempting to destabilize the world in their favor, NATO created a commando team of the five most elite soldiers they possessed. The commandos would be sent on only the most dangerous of missions where the odds of survival would be minimal. They would almost always be outnumbered, but never out gunned. These commandos are known as Sabre Team.

Embark on a campaign of fun and immersive missions of different types and sizes in which how you want to complete the mission is entirely up to you. All missions require no add-ons and are heavily tested to ensure the best quality.
